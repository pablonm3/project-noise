java simple music player, right now is working at the bases, check executable folder and run the .jar file if you wanna try it.
<br>
I would like to add more features like bpm detection and that kind of things for making an smart audio player, if you wanna check the code or have some suggestions, please be free to do the changes you want !
<br>
note : im a java learner and i do not know nothing about audio processing, so for sure there are things that could be improved, feel free to experimert !
